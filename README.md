- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Declan.

I'm new to programming and Github but am currently learning three.js and 3D development in my free time. 

My background is in filmmaking and post-production but more recently been working with video display technology such as LED & projection for virtual production.

My goal is to develop the skillset to build dynamic, sexy websites and apps for clients that integrate 3D art & design.
